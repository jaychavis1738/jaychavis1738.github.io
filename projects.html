  <p>Here are some of the personal and class projects I have completed and some that I am working on currently. These will change every few weeks or basically when I get them or think of new ones. I would really appreciate it if anyone would like to make comments or suggestions about what I can improve on in my projects or any new ideas for projects.</p>
  <p>I will attempt to do projects for the following programming languages as I learn them:
  <ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>C++</li></ul>
