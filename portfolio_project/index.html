  <p>Hello all, I am an aspiring programmer with an interest in anything I find fun. I am currently working on getting my associate degree in computer programming and development then transferring to a 4-year institution to get my bachelor’s. This webpage is a place to present myself and show off the different projects I am working on and have completed. I want to show people my skillset and get advice on things I can improve upon.  </p>
