  <p>Some things about me, my name is Jaylan, I am from North Coralina. I consider myself a hardworking person constantly trying to find ways to improve myself. My time is usually spent programming, gaming, and finding new hobbies I can try out. I like traveling. I have been to New York, Baltimore, and Washington DC. I want to be able to travel out of the country and see more places, however, thatâ€™s going to have to be saved for the future. My skillset centers around Python. I am still a little new to JavaScript, so it is going to be awhile before I start doing anything serious in that. However, it is a learning experience for me, so I do not mind it.</p>
