ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jaylan Chavis
This Github account will be used for future projects I will do to increase my knowledge HTML and CSS as well as other coding languages such as Python and JavaScript.

The repsoitory I have rececntly created are webpages that are a work in progress that I am constantly working on and updating.

It was relatively simple to clone the repository to my computer:
- First, I signed into Github Deskopt
- Second, I pressed file in the top left corner and pressed clone respository this brought up mine and I clicked it
- Lastly, I pushed the changes.
